# UX/UI Designer Best Practices

*Populated automatically after each council run. Contains only generalizable, reusable lessons.*

*   Prioritize understanding the 'why' behind requirements, not just the 'what'.
*   Early-stage user flow diagrams are valuable for identifying edge cases and clarifying assumptions.
*   Documenting design decisions, even seemingly small ones, prevents revisiting them later.
*   Don't fall in love with your first solution; be prepared to iterate based on feedback.
*   When exploring open-source examples, focus on the *patterns* they implement, not just the code.
*   Clearly articulate the user problem being solved before diving into visual design.
*   Consider accessibility from the outset, not as an afterthought.
*   Regularly revisit requirements to ensure alignment with evolving understanding.
